I'm Applied Mathematics student at Stellenbosch University with a growing passion for Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and the power of mathematics to shape the future.

I enjoy exploring how mathematical theory connects with real-world intelligent systems. Whether it's through numerical simulations, optimization algorithms, or data-driven models, I find it fascinating how abstract concepts can be translated into powerful tools that drive decision-making and automation. I’m especially interested in how ideas from calculus, linear algebra, and probability theory form the mathematical backbone of modern machine learning and artificial intelligence. Each line of code I write is a small step toward turning theory into reality and I believe that true innovation comes from deeply understanding the mathematics behind the models. As I grow in my academic journey, I’m constantly seeking out challenges, building meaningful projects, and preparing myself to contribute to breakthroughs that can make a lasting impact in the world.

Languages: Python(Intermediate), C++, Matlab, Mathematica, NumPy, Jupyter, SciPy, LaTeX  
Interests: Neural networks, Numerical Optimization, Predictive Modeling

I'm also experienced in working with Linux environments, where I use tools like the terminal, Bash scripting, and package management to develop, test, and run my projects efficiently. This has helped me gain greater control over my programming workflow and understand the system-level aspects of AI development.

Miscallenous: As a Maths student, I have read quite a few Mathematics books and In my opinion, I believe there's no such thing as a "wrong" answer in math only undiscovered logic.
