**Competitive Programmer & Aspiring ML/AI Engineer with interests in Software Engineering too**  

I'm a highly analytical developer/engineer from KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa.

My passion lies at the intersection of **algorithmic problem-solving**, **machine learning**, and **real-world intelligent systems**. I love exploring how core mathematical concepts—like calculus, linear algebra, probability, and optimization—power modern AI models. From numerical simulations to data-driven automation, I'm fascinated by turning abstract theory into scalable, impactful tools.

Currently building custom AI projects and preparing for remote software/ML engineering roles. Resilient and self-motivated, I've navigated personal challenges while excelling in high-pressure environments (e.g., competitive programming contests and advanced attending math seminars on Elliptic Curves & Riemann Zeta Function).
