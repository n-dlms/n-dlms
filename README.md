I'm an analytical engineer from South Africa.

Currently building custom Full Stack, ML/AI advanced projects. Resilient and self-motivated, I've navigated personal challenges while excelling in high-pressure environments (e.g., competitive programming contests and advanced attending and trying to understand math seminars on Elliptic Curves & Riemann Zeta Function).

 Tech Stack & Skills
- **Languages**: Python (Advanced – Streamlit, scikit-learn, NumPy, SciPy, NLP libs), C++ (Fluent), Java (Beginner), MATLAB, Mathematica, LaTeX
- **Tools/Env**: Linux (Bash scripting, terminal workflows), Jupyter, Git/GitHub, Discord for collab
- **ML/AI Focus**: Neural Networks, Predictive Modeling, Numerical Optimization, GPU/Parallel Computing (exploring)
- **Other**: Data Automation, Algorithmic Efficiency, Mathematical Modeling, Full Stack Engineering 

 Highlights
- **Competitive Programming**: Codeforces – consistently solving high-difficulty problems in data structures, graphs, DP, optimization etc.
- **Hackathons**: Intervarsity South African Hackathon participant (2025) – team collaboration via GitHub/Discord to solve real-world challenges under time pressure. I have also participated in Entelect 2025 SA University Cup with a friend.
- **Academic**: Former member Riemann Academy (2024) & Artificial Intelligence Society at Stellenbosch; presented/attended advanced seminars on cutting-edge math topics.
