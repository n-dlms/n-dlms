I'm a highly analytical developer/engineer from KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa.

My passion lies at the intersection of **Algorithmic problem-solving**, **Machine learning**, and **Real-world intelligent systems**. I love exploring how core mathematical concepts—like calculus, Linear Algebra, Probability, and optimization—power modern AI models. From numerical simulations to data-driven automation, I'm fascinated by turning abstract theory into scalable, impactful tools.

Currently building custom AI projects and preparing for remote software/ML engineering roles. Resilient and self-motivated, I've navigated personal challenges while excelling in high-pressure environments (e.g., competitive programming contests and advanced attending math seminars on Elliptic Curves & Riemann Zeta Function).

 Tech Stack & Skills
- **Languages**: Python (Advanced – Streamlit, scikit-learn, NumPy, SciPy, NLP libs), C++ (Fluent), Java (Beginner), MATLAB, Mathematica, LaTeX
- **Tools/Env**: Linux (Bash scripting, terminal workflows), Jupyter, Git/GitHub, Discord for collab
- **ML/AI Focus**: Neural Networks, Predictive Modeling, Numerical Optimization, GPU/Parallel Computing (exploring)
- **Other**: Data Automation, Algorithmic Efficiency, Mathematical Modeling, Full Stack Engineering 

 Highlights
- **Competitive Programming**: Codeforces – consistently solving high-difficulty problems in data structures, graphs, DP, optimization etc.
- **Hackathons**: Intervarsity South African Hackathon participant (2025) – team collaboration via GitHub/Discord to solve real-world challenges under time pressure. I have also participated in Entelect 2025 University Cup.
- **AI Projects**: Developing Python-based tools for data analysis, compliance automation, and workflow efficiency (Streamlit + scikit-learn + NLP).
- **Academic**: Former member Riemann Academy & Artificial Intelligence Society at Stellenbosch; presented/attended advanced seminars on cutting-edge math topics.

 Currently Working On
- Building open-source ML prototypes and algorithmic visualizers (repos coming soon, still in the build)
- Completing Google Data Analytics & DeepLearning.AI specializations on Coursera
- Exploring full-stack projects with FastAPI + React/Streamlit frontends
